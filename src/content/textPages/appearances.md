Iâ€™m an experienced SEO profession who enjoys sharing my experience with others and be part of the community. I have extensive experience with international, technical and enterprise SEO and very comfortable with languages such as JavaScript, Python, R and Git. 
Interesting in having me speak at an upcoming event or workshop? Send me a message.


<!-- I'm a software engineer who enjoys sharing my expertise with other developers and providing resources to make [contributing to open-source more approachable](https://stars.github.com/profiles/m0nica/). I have spoken about various [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) technologies such as React, MDX, GraphQL, Git/GitHub in various formats including in-depth workshops, conference talks, podcasts and screencasts.

In 2020, I was selected to be an inaugural [GitHub Star ðŸŒŸ](https://stars.github.com/profiles/m0nica/) based on my involvement in the tech community. My interest in the React ecosystem in particular led me to launch [React Ladies](https://www.reactladies.com/), a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.

Interesting in having me speak at an upcoming event or workshop? [Send me a message](/contacts/). -->
