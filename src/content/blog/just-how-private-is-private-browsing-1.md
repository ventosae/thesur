Like all good things, this one starts with a story. A story about how I discovered eye strain and why we created **[HappyEyes](https://happyeyes.io)**.

When lockdown began and we switched to the working-from-home mode, I truly enjoyed the first few months. Oh, that was a bliss, listening to music without headphones and conducting website migrations while eating cereal‚Ä¶ until my eyes started feeling peculiar. It felt as though ten trucks had driven up during the day and dumped loads of sand in them. They felt sore, dry and heavy. It was a new feeling ‚Äì and quite an unpleasant one. 

Something had to be done, so I employed a 3-step approach. 

## Follow the steps.

**1. Search for it:** I did what any sane person working from home would do. I googled my symptoms. To my big surprise, I did not get an immediate diagnosis of cancer from Dr. Google but rather, a simpler, more straightforward answer: eye strain, aka computer vision syndrome. (Shout out to all SEOs optimising for ‚ÄúEye Strain‚Äù as a keyword. You aced it.) 

<Interesting>But what, exactly, is eye strain? The American Academy of Ophthalmology explains that looking at digital devices won‚Äôt necessarily damage your eyesight, but it can cause strain and unpleasant symptoms. Humans normally blink around 15 times each minute. When staring at screens, this number decreases to a half or a third of that. That can lead to dry, irritated, tired eyes and even headaches.</Interesting>

**2. Go to the source:** Eye strain. That opened up a rabbit hole that I disappeared down, binge-reading research papers, articles and Reddit posts. And let me tell you, I was not alone. Just look at these stats!

Now, armed with all this data and an idea of what I was dealing with, it was time to look for a solution. And it was an easy one: take regular breaks from the screen, do easy eye exercises and find a structured way to combine them both. The table below shows a few ideas I came up with and why they got rejected.

<Stat>
1Ô∏è‚É£
The 2016 Digital Eye Strain report, which included survey responses from over 10,000 US adults, identified an overall self-reported symptom prevalence of 65%, with females more commonly affected than males (69% vs 60% prevalence).

2Ô∏è‚É£Digital eye strain has a signiÔ¨Åcant impact on both visual comfort and occupational productivity, since around **40% of adults and up to 80% of teenagers may experience signiÔ¨Åcant visual symptoms** (principally eye strain, tired and dry eyes), both during and immediately after viewing electronic displays.

3Ô∏è‚É£Digital eye strain (DES), also known as computer vision syndrome, encompasses a range of ocular and visual symptoms, and **estimates suggest 50% or more of computer users experience it.**s

| Solution                      | Why it was rejected                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use a timer on my phone       | Too much destruction (constant risk of getting stuck on Instagram)                                               |
| Download the app on the phone | A good solution, but I‚Äôm trying to stay away from the phone during the day for productivity reasons              |
| Download a desktop app        | Almost no options available, and you can‚Äôt install anything on a work laptop                                     |
| Find a web app                | Sounds like a best solution, but the best web app available is made with flash (it‚Äôs not even supported anymore) |
| Create my own app             | Sounds like too much work ‚Äì but wait a second‚Ä¶ ü§î                                                                |

It became apparent that there was no decent web app (aka website) on the market that allows you to take breaks and do eye exercises. 

## Build it.

During one of the standups at work, I brought up the topic of eye strain and, oh boy, I‚Äôve learned that quite a few people experienced similar symptoms. That‚Äôs how (after a few Zoom calls) we teamed up with [Dima](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dkovtunov/). to create something which would suit our needs and help with eye strain. And after a few dozen Zoom calls and brainstorming sessions, Happy Eyes was born (thanks to Dima‚Äôs outstanding React skills). 

Why **[HappyEyes](https://happyeyes.io)**? 

Simple! Happy Eyes is the only eye strain related web app on the market which:

* Can have a number of timers running simultaneously 
* Can send notifications to take breaks 
* Is mobile friendly 
* Looks pretty as hell (thanks, Evgenia [Evgenia](https://www.behance.net/byshikzhe), for great UX design)
